# Instru-Martin-Nick

This is the STM32 code built using the STM32Cube IDE for the STM32F446 Nucleo-64. It performs to function of an LCR meter with the use of the fourier analysis of a signal provided by a pre-built ABB based circuit. Our code successfully analysised the DUT in terms of resistance and capacitance.
